# Module 01: What is OpenShift Used For?

## Some Vocabulary

* Kubernetes - an open-source container orchestration system.
* Container - your software plus everything else it depends on to run.
* Orchestration - the automated configuration, coordination, and management of computer systems and software.
* OpenShift - a commercial distribution of Kubernetes, made by Red Hat.
* Image - a read-only file that used to create containers.
* Image Stream - one or more images identified by labels.
* Label - text that is added to images to give special meaning to users.
* Pod - one or more containers that run together. This is the smallest thing that Kubernetes actually orchestrates.
* Service - provides a common DNS name to access a pod (or set of pods).
* Project - a group of services that are related to each other in some way.
* Application - any computer software made to help a user to do specific things.
* Deployment - any change to your application, that is started by a image change or a configuration change.
* Build - the process of turning your source code into an image that containers can be created from.
* BuildConfig - configuration data that determines how to manage your build.
* Route - a labeled and DNS mapped network path to a service from outside OpenShift.
* Operator - a way of packaging, deploying and managing a Kubernetes application.
* Cluster - made up of master and worker nodes.
* Master node - schedules things that are meant to happen, watches for problems, and orchestrates everything. In the real world, there are usually at least three of these.
* Worker node - where the pods run. In the real world, there are usually two or more of these.
